<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Daven and this page attempts to reduce my life down to a single page of text. Here goes... </p>
<p>I was a teacher in Japan for 8 years, but ultimately changed my career to a software engineer. <a href="/blog/from-teacher-to-swe/" class="">Here's how I did it.</a></p>
<p>I spent my childhood doing what amounts to the following three things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>playing with computers</li>
    <li>playing Dance Dance Revolution</li>
    <li>playing video games</li>

</ul>

<p>In elementary school, I was building computers for friends and family. By high school I was using OllyDb to create my own rules within the games I enjoyed.</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Waterloo, where I got my butt kicked by the course curriculum. By sheer luck, I got an offer to come to Japan for the JET programme and left everything I knew to come. Little did I know, I would still be here 10 years later.</p>
